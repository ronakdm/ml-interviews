# ml-interviews

## Background
This repo contains links and instructional materials to help prepare for industry machine learning (ML) interviews (data/applied/research scientist, ML engineer, etc). It is primarily aimed at Master's and Ph.D. students. While there are innumerable resources online for learning ML, this amalgamation of courses, papers, blog articles, and Twitter threads form daunting list of concepts and algorithms. The goal of this repo is to distill the topics that are useful for the recruiting process
in graduate-level internships and full-time roles.

- **Statistics Basics:** Theoretical and applied statistics concepts such as deriving the distribution of a random variable, testing for equality of predictive performance, etc. See `statistics.md`.
- **Implementation Basics:** Simple algorithms which you may be asked to implement on the spot, such as $k$-nearest neighbors or $k$-means clustering. See `implementation.ipynb`.
- **Trade-offs:** Enumeration of various trade-offs between desirable properties that come up in discussions, such as bias-variance, precision-recall, and accuracy-fairness. See `tradeoffs.md`.
- **Advanced Topics:** Modern methods for sequence modeling (e.g. transformers) and image modeling (e.g. deep ConvNets) as well as data representation and preprocessing. See `sequence.ipynb` and `image.ipynb`.
- **Applied ML:** Examples of a question in which the interviewer asks you to design an ML solution to create a business product. See `applied.md`.
