# ml-interviews
This repo contains instructional materials and code to help prepare for industry machine learning (ML) interviews (data/applied/research scientist, ML engineer, etc). Because of the vastness of ML topics, the goal of this material is to cover topics that are most relevant for interviewing specifically. These topics are:

- **Basic Statistics:** Theoretical and applied statistics concepts such as deriving the distribution of a random variable, testing for equality of predictive performance, etc. See `statistics.md`.
- **Basic Implementation:** Simple algorithms which you may be asked to implement on the spot, such as $k$-nearest neighbors or $k$-means clustering. See `implementation.ipynb`.
- **Trade-offs:** Enumeration of various trade-offs between desirable properties that come up in discussions, such as bias-variance, precision-recall, and accuracy-fairness. See `tradeoffs.md`.
- **Advanced Topics:** Modern methods for sequence modeling (e.g. transformers) and image modeling (e.g. deep ConvNets) as well as data representation and preprocessing. See `sequence.ipynb` and `image.ipynb`.
- **Applied ML:** Examples of a question in which the interviewer asks you to design an ML solution to create a business product. See `applied.md`.
